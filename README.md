## üìî Some of Facts
* There are 23 design patterns that were identified and documented in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides). </br>
* These patterns are categorized into 3 main categories based on their purpose and functionality: </br>
  * 1 - Creational Patterns: These patterns are concerned with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
    * Abstract Factory
    * Builder
    * Factory Method
    * Prototype
    * Singleton
  * 2 - Structural Patterns: These patterns are concerned with object composition and the relationships between objects, aiming to form larger structures from individual objects.
    * Adapter
    * Bridge
    * Composite
    * Decorator
    * Facade
    * Flyweight
    * Proxy
  * 3 - Behavioral Patterns: These patterns are concerned with object communication and how objects collaborate to perform tasks.
    * Chain of Responsibility
    * Command
    * Interpreter
    * Iterator
    * Mediator
    * Memento
    * Observer
    * State
    * Strategy
    * Template Method
    * Visitor
* Note: there are other design patterns that have been developed outside of these set, but the 23 patterns described above are the most commonly known and used.
